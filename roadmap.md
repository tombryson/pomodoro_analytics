Certainly! Implementing a goals feature like you're suggesting is a multi-step process that requires updates to both the data layer and the presentation layer of your application. Here are the broad steps:

1. **Data Structure for Goals**: First, you need to create a data structure to keep track of the goals. This could be as simple as a JavaScript object that maps a task name to a goal value.

    ```js
    const goals = {
      "piano": 20, // 20 hours
      // add more goals here
    };
    ```

2. **UI for Inputting Goals**: Create a UI component that allows the user to specify goals. This could be a simple input field and a dropdown to select the task.

3. **Storing Goals**: Depending on your application, you may want to store these goals in local storage, or send them to a server for persistent storage.

4. **Updating Goals**: Implement a function that adjusts the goal based on the time spent on a task.

5. **Display Goals on the Graph**: Update your graphing component to draw a line at the goal level. Use a different color or dashed line to distinguish it from the regular data.

6. **Inverse Graph Feature**: Create a new graphing component that starts at the goal and decreases as time is spent on tasks.

### Step by Step Implementation

#### Step 1: Data Structure for Goals
```js
const [goals, setGoals] = useState({ "piano": 20 });
```

#### Step 2: UI for Inputting Goals
You could add a form with a dropdown to select the task and an input field to specify the goal.

#### Step 3: Storing Goals
For simplicity, let's store it in the component state for now.

#### Step 4: Updating Goals
This could be part of your existing data processing logic. Every time you add time spent on a task, you would reduce the corresponding goal value.

#### Step 5: Display Goals on the Graph
You can add a `VictoryLine` component with static data to represent the goal.

```jsx
<VictoryLine
  data={[
    { x: new Date().getTime(), y: goals.piano },
    { x: new Date().getTime() + (6 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), y: goals.piano }
  ]}
  style={{ data: { stroke: "black", strokeDasharray: "5,5" } }}
/>
```

#### Step 6: Inverse Graph Feature
In this version, you would start at the goal and subtract any time spent.

```jsx
const inverseData = summaryArray.map(item => ({
  x: new Date(item.date).getTime(),
  y: goals[project] - item.seconds,
}));
```

Then use `inverseData` in a `VictoryLine`.

I've skipped the exact code for brevity, but these are the high-level steps you would need to follow to implement this feature. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific step?
